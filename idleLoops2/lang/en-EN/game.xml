                <a>Short runs are better, for the early game and current balance. But as your runs get longer and you accrue
                    talent and soulstones, longer runs become more useful.

                Wrong place and wrong time. You were visiting the village next to yours, looking for work, when monsters attacked! Wolves, trolls, ogres, even a chimera destroyed the town while you were hiding under cover.
                When your cover was destroyed by a stray fireball from the defenders, you ran out in the open - just in time for a platinum adventurer to conjure an elemental, right underneath you.
                You blacked out, and when you came to, the monsters were all defeated, and cleanup was underway. You helped for a bit, but then you suddenly collapsed - painlessly, thankfully - and the world went dark.
                You woke up, and you were back where you were, minutes ago! You were looping in time! Desperately, you tried to run, but in about the same time, it happened again.
                A few more loops, and you accidentally ran into a vase with water in it - and then the loop lasted just a little longer. After some experimentation, it seems that your mana is your clock, and when it runs out - time resets.
                Hopefully there's enough mana around you to get enough time to do something meaningful. For now, you need to search for more mana water, and figure out how to use it better.

            <explanation><![CDATA[
          Each stat level reduces the relevant part of an action's mana cost by 1%.<br>
          Talent exp gain is equal to 1% of stat exp gain, and persists through loops.<br>
          Talent multiplies xp gain by (1+(talentLevel)^0.4/3).<br>
          XP gain towards a stat per action is (original mana / actual mana) * (talent bonus) per tick.<br>
          Total Mult is a combination of your talent and soulstone bonuses.<br><br>
          e.g. Meet People costs 800 mana and has a breakdown of <div class="bold">Int</div> 10% <div class="bold">Cha</div> 80% <div class="bold">Soul</div> 10%.<br>
          This effectively means 80 of the mana is controlled by <div class="bold">Int</div>, another 80 by <div class="bold">Soul</div>, and the remaining 640 by <div class="bold">Cha</div>.<br>
          If your <div class="bold">Cha</div> is level 20 when the action is started, the bonus would be x1.2 so it'd be 640 / 1.2 = 533.33<br>
          Adding back the 160 from <div class="bold">Soul</div> and <div class="bold">Int</div>, the total mana the action takes (rounded up) is now 694, so ~87% of the original mana cost.<br>
          The action would give (800/694)*(1+(talent)^0.4/3) level exp per mana for the 694 mana.]]></explanation>
