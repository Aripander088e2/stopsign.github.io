PROCESSES:
Adding a new Standard Buff

1. New block in SpellData.js, fill in data
2. Add to the relevant stat in Hero































THOUGHTS:

4 Paths open (to start)
Each path has the same base, but with a different twist
Each path improves itself greatly, and other paths less so
Player can choose to focus on one or get multiple at a time
Focusing is more efficient to improving itself, but not to attacking





Theme
gamingmau: in a world where everyone has magic, you're the only person without it, yet you somehow manage to enter a mages tournament to determine the top mage. seeing as everyone there is a top mage in there field, you learn magic by either befriending or beating the other mages. hows that sound phurple?
and your unique ability is to not actually lose magic power, and opponents aren't used to actually injuring someone - just taking their magic power - so they stop.
you'd get 5 chances to leech for free and then the fights on, to test out a hard opponent or something
obscurans: oooo magic combat is until someone forgets their spells and surrenders?



Archangel100: you could link prestiging to dimensional magic, where you hopt to a parallel dimension where you died, but are weakened by the process



You're a wizard, who's decided to practice a lot (for... reasons). You cast spells all the time, and you can set your playstyle.
You have mana regen to spend
You have exp and a level
There's a terminal with flavor output
Leveling up changes:
	Exp per spell cast
	Health
	Attack
	max charges



difficulty modifier changes:
	Dodge %
	Attack
	Health
	-Armor
	Hit %  / Accuracy
	Block %


Fight Easy (don't have to regen much, more items, $)
	Random from the magic you have selected,
Fight Hard (have to regen more, less items but better ones, less $)
Talk Easy
Craft - lategame stuff
	Better Wood Type (increase base atk)
	Better Enchant (increase base mana gain)

	standard buff = X by 1 % level, lasts 5 seconds * level, stacks by adding the time
	standard dmg = standard buff + builds to Y charges

	each level increases time needed by 10
	each spell unlocks after the previous one has level 100 * level
	increasing boosts for overcharging it basically

	i want your actions to be automated movements around a map/minimap. You choose (Fight [Easy, Hard], Craft [Wood, Metal, Art], Fight: [Cast Ash [x], Cast Gravity [x], Cast Dust [x]]), etc.

	How about something like magic can only be wielded via artifcats or something, or ike, gems embedded in the boddy
