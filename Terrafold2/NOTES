Terrafold 2

Lakes
    capacity, generator intake, overflow are upgradeable via iron
    power ratio upgradeable later

Lake 0
    Purpose: get iron from electricity

    Start with 1 c.bot
    Mine ore | bot count | amount | progress (seconds) | auto
        1 elec, 20 seconds
    Process ore |
        gives 1 iron, 1 dirt
        2 elec, 5 seconds
    Build c.bots |
        3 elec, 5 seconds, 1 iron
    Build c.bots with iron
        Mine ore
            c.Bot intensive, low electricity
        Process ore
            Low c.bot, high electricity
        Build c.bots
            cost iron, click
    Upgrade generator - 10 iron * 1.1^# - +1% efficiency
    Upgrade intake - 100 iron * 1.1^# - 10%

Lake 1
    Purpose: get atmosphere from electricity
    Drill Hole |
        1 elec, 10 second, 10m
        Creates volcano, volcano lasts for 60 seconds (disables drill hole)
        Pressure starts at 100%
        Each hole multiplies pressure by .9
        Pressure builds at .001% per tick - not when volcano is running though
        volcano reqs 500m / pressure
        spews .07 H2O, .03 CO2 per tick
    Upgrade generator - 100 iron * 1.1^# - +1% efficiency
    Upgrade intake - 1000 iron * 1.1^# - 10%


Lake 2
    Purpose: get oxygen from electricity
    Place dirt |
    Spread dirt |
    Irrigate soil |
        Increases max groundwater soil can take
        Groundwater slowly leaks into underground water, which feeds back into lake 2
    Plant seeds |
        Uses groundwater, CO2, produces O2, puts H2O back in atmosphere (transpiration)
    O2 Unlocks livable water ?
        oxygenated water -> algae farms -> Insect farms -> fisheries -> small $$ to start, tourism later
    O2 for creating pneumatic tools
        better drills
    O2 for smelting
        create steel



Lake 3
    Purpose: get money from electricity
