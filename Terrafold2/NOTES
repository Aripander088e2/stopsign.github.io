steel upgrades to make mine ore more elec > process ore > c.bot
1 buttons for add amount
max, half button for c.bots



Lake 2
    Purpose: get oxygen from electricity
Irrigate to redirect water
Plants take groundwater, carbon dioxide, and produce oxygen, putting water in atmosphere (transpiration)

    Farm
    repair farm bot - 100 iron
    Place dirt - cbots
        Show baseLand, (max land),
        land as resource above

    Spread dirt -> land - fbots (optimize)
    plant seeds (fbots)
        puts seeds around land
    water plants (fbots)
        adds constant amount to groundwater
        plants absorb at a linear rate
        groundwater goes back into lake
        plants have a lifespan and effectiveness
        effectivness drops if no water
        plants take CO2 from localAtmo, send O2 + H2O into atmo/clouds (transpiration)

    Steel Plant
    Smelt Steel
        Uses O2 + iron, gives steel
    Weld Farm Bot
        Uses 10 cbots + steel + O2, gives f.bot

Lake 3
    Purpose: get money from electricity
    aerate water - uses co2, elec

Lake 4
    Purpose: get population, scrip from electricity

Lake 5
    Purpose: get happiness from electricity

Lake 6
    Purpose: science

Lake 7
    Purpose: industry

Lake 8
    Purpose: military

FIN

need:
use endless c.bots w/o elec
OR limit c.bots

possible science upgrades:
    volcano lasts longer
    river transfers faster
    stronger wind
