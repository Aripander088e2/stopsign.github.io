Lakes
    capacity, generator intake, overflow are upgradeable via iron
    power ratio upgradeable later

Lake 0
    Purpose: get iron from electricity

    Upgrade generator - 10 iron * #^2 - +1% efficiency
    Upgrade intake - 10 steel * 1.1^# - +100%


Lake 1
    Purpose: get atmosphere from electricity
    Drill Hole |
        1 elec, 10 second, 10m
        Creates volcano, volcano lasts for 60 seconds (disables drill hole)
        Pressure starts at 100%
        Each hole multiplies pressure by .9
        Pressure builds at .001% per tick - not when volcano is running though
        volcano reqs 500m / pressure
        spews .07 H2O, .03 CO2 per tick
    Upgrade generator - 100 iron * 1.1^# - +1% efficiency
    Upgrade intake - 1000 iron * 1.1^# - 10%


Lake 2
    Purpose: get oxygen, steel from electricity
    build dam - 50 iron, 2000 dirt
    Farm
    repair farm bot - 100 iron
    Place dirt - cbots
    Spread dirt -> land - fbots (optimize)
    plant seeds (fbots)
        puts seeds around land
    water plants (fbots)
        adds constant amount to groundwater
        plants absorb at a linear rate
        groundwater goes back into lake
        plants have a lifespan and effectiveness
        effectivness drops if no water
        plants take CO2 from localAtmo, send O2 + H2O into atmo/clouds (transpiration)

    Steel Plant
    Smelt Steel
        Uses O2 + iron, gives steel
    Weld Farm Bot
        Uses 10 cbots + steel + O2, gives f.bot

Lake 3
    Purpose: get money from electricity
    aerate water - uses co2, elec

Lake 4
    Purpose: get population, scrip from electricity

Lake 5
    Purpose: get happiness from electricity

Lake 6
    Purpose: science

Lake 7
    Purpose: industry

Lake 8
    Purpose: military

FIN

need:
use endless c.bots w/o elec
OR limit c.bots

possible science upgrades:
    volcano lasts longer
    river transfers faster
    stronger wind
