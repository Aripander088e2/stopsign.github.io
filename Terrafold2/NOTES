Evaporation
    % of total water in lakes gets sent to atmosphere
    Wind sweeps atmosphere every 5 minutes, collecting 90% moisture
    clouds rain harder the larger they are, adding water to the feature they're hovering over


Lakes
    minimum - amount of water before generator intake starts
    capacity - amount of water they can hold
    generator intake - rate of water leaving the lake, up to capacity
    power ratio - rate of electricity per intake
    overflow - rate of water beyond capacity leaving the lake

    capacity, generator intake, overflow are upgradeable via iron
    power ratio upgradeable later

Lake 0
    Purpose: get iron from electricity
    minimum: 10
    capacity: 1000
    intake: .01/tick
    power: 1 per 100 water through intake
    overflow: 1%

    Build c.bots with iron
        Mine ore
            c.Bot intensive, low electricity
        Process ore
            Low c.bot, high electricity
        Build c.bots

Lake 1
    Purpose: get atmosphere from electricity
Minimum:200
Capacity:10000
Intake:  .01
Power: 1 per 100
Overflow:1%
Use electricity for drills
Induce volcanoes
    Heat *slightly* lowers
    Pressure builds based on heat
    (eventually need to reheat)
Use electricity for heat, make volcanoes
Volcanoes release NH3, H20, CO2.
NH3 slowly burns into N2, which stays
H20 goes to clouds
CO2 stays




Lake 2
    Purpose: get oxygen from electricity
Irrigate to redirect water
Plants take groundwater, carbon dioxide, and produce oxygen, putting water in atmosphere (transpiration)


Lake 3
    Purpose: get science from electricity
