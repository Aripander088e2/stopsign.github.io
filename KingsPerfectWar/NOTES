        Make combat more interesting and less one-dimensional
        build up over time
        can't be accessed immediately in the level - requires minimal propagation

switching levels / level design
    when all hideouts are cleared, level is complete and "next" arrow appears
    restart on level clear option, default off
    levels scale in time from ~1 minute to ~15 minutes over ~20 levels
    make a random level generator?
    1 time prizes of WIS/INT on *very* difficult dungeons every few levels, starting at 5
    increasing gold prizes and EXP for clearing each level to entice players to stay at peak

tutorial
    level 1 - send king to kill hideout
    level 2 - send king to kill dungeon, get unique reward of exp, use train, kill hideout
    level 3 - send king to kill 1st hideout for initial gold/wood, build economy, build barracks/spearman, kill 2nd hideout
    level 4 - have initial gold/wood, defend against attackers (barely doesn't kill king), aura intro, dungeon is weak but far away w/ mana, build economy/units, kill 2nd hideout
    level 5 - regular level, talk to people intro
    level 6-10 - regular level
    level 11 - regular level, shrine, total mana should be ~4-5k



    regular level - have initial gold/wood, attackers come later, dungeons for mana and hideouts for gold

additional ideas -
    rally peasants / send mercenaries / send assassins - auto-creates units and sends them at the nearest base w/o a unique reward
