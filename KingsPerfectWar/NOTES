tutorial
    level 1 - send king to kill hideout
    level 2 - send king to kill dungeon, get unique reward of exp, use train, kill hideout
    level 3 - send king to kill 1st hideout for initial gold/wood, build economy, build barracks/spearman, kill 2nd hideout
    level 4 - have initial gold/wood, defend against attackers (barely doesn't kill king), aura intro, dungeon is weak but far away w/ mana, build economy/units, kill 2nd hideout
    level 5 - regular level, talk to people intro
    level 6-10 - regular level
    level 11 - regular level, shrine, total mana should be ~4-5k



    regular level - have initial gold/wood, attackers come later, dungeons for mana and hideouts for gold

additional ideas -
    rally peasants / send mercenaries / send assassins - auto-creates units and sends them at the nearest base w/o a unique reward
