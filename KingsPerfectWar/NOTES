    make a random level generator?

        every 1k extra gold becoems 1 soul crystal
        first units built become highest tier
        these are king actions that take 20*(tier) seconds each

            1000 SC - spearman x10
            5000 SC - archer x10

            etc.
heroes

        Make combat more interesting and less one-dimensional
        build up over time
        can't be accessed immediately in the level - requires minimal propagation

additional ideas -
    rally peasants / send mercenaries / send assassins - auto-creates units and sends them at the nearest base w/o a unique reward
