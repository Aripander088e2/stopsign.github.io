additional ideas -
    need more goals than "overcome next wall". Consider sprawling in a different direction?
        dungeons for king/heroes
        research technologies / magic
        alternate uses of soul crystals
        new power systems / damage types
        inner world growth
        apprentice

    rally peasants / send mercenaries / send assassins - auto-creates units and sends them at the nearest base w/o a unique reward

Questions -
    Better way to re-arrange Stats? Or Extras?
