          <q>Short runs seem better.</q>
          <a>Short runs are better, for the early game and current balance. As your runs get longer and you accrue talent and soulstones they become more useful.</a>

          <q>What should my first goal be?</q>

        You're a simple courier, on a long trip to deliver a high priority package. Just as you entered town, you tripped - breaking your glasses - and the package burst open, spilling a strange liquid on you. Immediately, your meager amount of mana started draining rapidly. Right as your mana became empty, you found yourself back in the moment the liquid was absorbed into your skin, with your tiny reserves filled... yet draining just as before. This happened again and again, the world resetting with you, until you decided you had to figure out a way to prolong how long these 'loops' were. Mana crystals are often stored in pottery around town, perhaps you'll start there ...
      </story>
      <story num="1">
        You reach the end of the dungeon, where a softly glowing orb floats on a pedastal. You've found the dungeon core - for the first level of the dungeon, at least. As you grasp it, the essence dives into you, infusing your very being with the power it holds. It is a small amount of power, but this is a small dungeon. You'll be back to take this power again, knowing with the foreign knowledge implanted that it will stay with you no matter when you are.
      </story>
      <story num="2">
        You reach the end of the dungeon again, but for the first time the core isn't glowing. It's always been thought that dungeon cores build based on the mana spent around them, but you're beginning to think the essence of it's previous incarnations drains it somehow. It doesn't always happen, but you'll need to put more mana into the world to take the core's benefits out of it. You shrug, accepting yet another oddity of the loops.
