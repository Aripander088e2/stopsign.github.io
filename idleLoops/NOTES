chance 'recovers' .001% per tick

Fight monsters - roughly require combat skill, Str, Spd, Con for gold
Clear small dungeon - roughly require magic+combat skill, Dex, Luck for permanent exp gains (like a 2nd talent)
buy supplies - 500 mana, costs 400 gold, required to travel
haggle - 250 mana and 1 reputation, reduce supplies cost by 20
travel to next town - 6k mana, requires supplies, can no longer use any of the 25 actions of town 1

Heal the Sick, 2.5k mana, requires 10 magic skill, gives 3 reputation
Fight monsters, 2k mana, requires 10 combat skill, gives 50 gold
Clear small dungeon, 4k mana, requires 15 combined warrior/mage levels, gives decreasing chance for soulstones, which let you improve what stats you want manually and last through loops
Buy supplies, 500 mana, costs 400 gold, required to travel
Haggle, 250 mana and 1 reputation, reduce supplies cost by 20

Travel to next town, 6k mana, requires supplies, resets wander/met % and reputation, making the relevant skills unable for the new town
