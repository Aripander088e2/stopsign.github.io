TODO:

Put a cap on spawn rate
BUG:
  attack power of units is universal, instead of when it gets created
  solution:
    use a variable to make an instance of the unit
    average that variable together based on unitcount when they merge


IMPROVEMENT:
Color code the difficulty of the next level based on # units spawning * total unit growth
  
HELPFUL:
Tooltips:
  Spells - Get 10 max mana on level up, more mana gain, and cheaper spells.
  Fireball - 
  Chain Lightning - Does 18 damage to 3 units!

IMPROVEMENT:
Graphics on the bullet
slow down the bullet

NECESSARY:
Sell land for Construction Workers
-<tree>100, +.5 Construction rate
(The price increases by 50 each time)
Can only purchase with unused Territory
<disable it until <price+10>>
<saves and loads too>

IMPROVEMENT:
reset button at the top of battle
