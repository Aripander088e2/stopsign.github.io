        <h3>Games to Play</h3>
        <div class="gameDescription">
            <a href="Pull_of_War/index.html">Pull of War</a><br>
            My most developed game. When you load, you'll be on "Unit Spawning" - click Barracks, then Battle to start the game<br>
            This game has saving, but no offline progress. It works at full speed in another tab.
            <br>
            I've spent ~100 hours on this total. It is my fourth attempt at a game. <br>
            The idea came from Desert Strike, a custom game in SC2, and other such Tug of War games. <br>
            It uses angular.js, but only for two-way binding - I'm not a fan of the organization that angular brings.<br>
            Many of the graphics are "placeholder". This game is a statement of what I can and cannot do, and I'm no graphics artist.<br>
            The aspect of idle games that I'm focusing on is needing to watch the game in order to know where to spend your money.<br>

            <a href="progressBarQuest3/index.html">Progress Bar Quest 3rd</a><br>
            Fun with progress bars. There's lots of unused features in this version.<br>
            This game no saving, and sort-of works in another tab.<br>
            It goes too fast, and breaks<br>
            <br>
            ~30 hours of work or so. This is my fifth game.<br>
            I abandoned this because the coding was terrible - it's all in one file.<br>
            It uses angular.js for the two-way binding. This was also my first attempt at passing functions as parameters.<br>
            I still think this has potential, but it's got quite a bit of cleanup needed.<br>
